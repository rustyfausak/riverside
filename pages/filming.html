      <h3 class="subtitle">Filming Ultimate</h3>

      <p>
        We use a custom 3 camera rig for filming our games. It is set up on a tall tripod
        and staked down at the start of the game. All 3 cameras are recording for
        the entire game. Afterward the footage is edited and uploaded.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rig allows us to set it up, start recording, and focus on the game. No operator
        or cameraman is necessary. Editing afterwards is fairly quick (around 20-30 minutes per
        game).
      </p>

      <p>
        The main downside to a setup like this is that the field of view is wide, so detailed
        action shots (like what would be used in an ESPN highlight) are not available. Instead
        you get a good overview that can be used as a teaching tool or for players in the game to review.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's possible that this rig could be improved with higher resolution cameras, higher
        quality lenses, more cameras, more rigs, etc. This setup is just about the bare minimum,
        price-wise, to get a full tournament on film without needing any work on the day-of.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Editing</h3>

      <p>
        I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci Resolve</a>
        to edit because it's free and supports multicam editing. The process I use to edit is documented in this
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t52DUwuu2Q">How-To Multicam Edit</a> video on our YouTube channel.

              Plenty of height to get over spectators and get a nice view.
              Needs to be staked down. I had to drill holes in the legs so that
              I could stake it. Could probably get by with some sandbags instead.

              These are just cheap GoPRO knockoffs. I don't know how the quality compares to GoPRO but it is
              sufficient for our needs. It is important that the camera can record at 60FPS at the max resolution.

              128GB gives just enough room for a whole tournament. Each hour of film is about 12GB. You
              could save money here and get 64GB cards ($20/ea) and dump the footage after each day. I
              don't always have a computer available to do this at remote tournaments.

              13000mAh gets all 3 cameras through about 5 hours. I'd probably go with a 20000mAh pack if you
