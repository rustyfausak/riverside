This area is normally blank.

If a player photo is available, place it in "static/photos/players/<year>/<team>/<first>-<last>.jpg",
and delete the "is_photo_missing: 1" line.

This filename should be of the format "<first>-<last>.md". The player photo should be named "<first>-<last>.jpg".
The "name" option above should those filenames and be "<first> <last>".

Each player will get their own file inside their team's folder.
